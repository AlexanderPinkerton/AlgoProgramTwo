==========Program Design==========
This program was designed to compute the Normalized Edit Distance and
the Longest common sub-sequence between two strings with ease and precision.
This program uses Dynamic Programming to keep the calculations at O( n^2 ) while
only requiring the use of linear memory. The two strings are provided into the
program by the use of command line arguments.


==========File Breakdown==========
-Main.java: Program execution starting point, obtains strings and passes them to the utility class.

-StringComparisonUtility.java:  Utility class that has a few computation methods.
   -computeEditDistance: This method will return the normalized edit distance computed with linear memory.
   -computeEditDistanceTable This method will create and populate the entire dynamic programming calculations table.
   -FindLCS: This method will use the full table and backtrace through it to obtain the LCS in O(n^2) time.


==========What Works==========:
--All features.



==========Data Structure Design:==========
I used standard int arrays as I do not need to resize them at any point. They are fast and efficient for this task.
